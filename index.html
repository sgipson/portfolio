           and tricks. Afterward we had to talk about our experience with the course and how we could use these newfound skills to become better
           searchers of information. This short blog post is my reaction and explanation of what I discovered.</h4>

           <p>These are my own thoughts and feelings on the final project for the second semester of this program. We were divided into teams and
           asked to build a website. I was the project manager and it was my job to keep the project on schedule and on task.
           I felt that I had several successes and some failures. The purpose of this blog post was an act of self reflection and in reflecting on our
           success and failures we can learn and move forward to do better than we did before.</p>

            and also a link to the Spacex website itself. I am pleased with how it turned out. I think I captured the feel of Spacex while maintaining my own sense of design. This project was a great tool in sharpening my skills in crafting websites.</p>

              <p>This is the final project of our second semester. My team and I built this website from the ground up. We were given the task of creating a website for a pizza place that was moving onto campus. I was the project manager and it was my job
              to keep the project on schedule and on task. Our criteria was pretty broad so we had plenty of room to be as creative as possible. We decided to link the pizza place to the university so we called our pizza place Helen’s Pizza.
              From there we designed our own logo and started building a website. Along with the website we had to have a database that would accept and track orders. I ended up working on the database while the rest of the team really focused on creating
              the website. Our final project ended up turning out fantastic and I am super proud of it. </p>

               I was able to get data into the database and search that data and get meaningful information from it. All of that was the goal and I and my team achieved that goal with this database. (If you will contact me I can get you the user name and password to see the database</p>

               <p>This was an exercise in class where we were introduced to jQuery. jQuery is a JavaScript library that allows users to use less code to do the same job as JavaScript. Many large companies such as Google and Netflix utilize jQuery every day.
               This exercise involved creating a small rotating gallery of some galaxies. To create this was just a task of adding the images to an HTML document, styling those images, and then using function that would call on the jQuery library to run
               the script.</p>

                <p>This was our individual project of our second semester. We were tasked with creating our own website and linking it to a database. Designing the website was a fun challenge. I had a ton of fun building this website.
                In keeping with my terribly sarcastic side I decided that this site would be obnoxious and bright and ready to sell the most ridiculous product I could think of. I decided that inflatable arm men would be my item of choice and so I began
                to craft a website to sell them.  Here is that website complete with a goofy gif and the classic Family Guy sketch. While the website itself is fun, what I want to draw attention to is the navigation bar that takes you the various tab.
                I uses a jQuery function that tabbed off each “page” and when a user clicked from one to the next it would hide the previous one and make the new one active, essentially making four pages into one.</p>

                 <p>A skill that I do not believe is utilized very often in the world but an important skill none the less. We spent a long while in our first semester talking about listening and how critical it is. Then we moved to active listening which
                 is even more important. There is a incredible difference between listening and active listening. As a class we went over that distinction many times over. Active listening involves being engaged with whoever is talking and ensuring you
                 truly understand what they are saying. This blog post explored my understanding of active listening and how we use not only our ears but also our heart, head, etc in active listening.</p>

 <div id="project">
    <p> Above are some of the documents I created for the project to ensure that we kept things orderly and on track. One is a change form that would allow a team member or our client to make a change to our project. The second is our communication schedule.
    this document might be the most important document I worked on. Even though this was a very small project communication between the team and our client was paramount.</p>

              <p>Along with all of the tech work I have done I am also a historian. Most of my collegiate work as been in history. With the following two pieces of work I would like to highlight my skills in writing and in researching. The first sample is
              a midterm for my capstone class which focused on the United States during the 1930's. These two eassys exam entertainment in the 1930's and also three articles that I read during the course that highlighted life in the 1930's. </p>

               <div id="project">
                  <p>This is my final paper for my 1930's class. This paper examined how truly horrifying the Great Depression was and how people of all backgrounds were effected by the Depression. This paper was difficult to write and not just because of the length.
                  Reading about what people of this country went through just to survive was astounding. Everyone learns about the Great Depression but to truly examine it and its ramifications on people's daily life was gut wrenching.</p>
